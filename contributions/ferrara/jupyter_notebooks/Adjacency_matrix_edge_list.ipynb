    "If we represent a network with an adjacency matrix, (a graph, see custom data structures), we make a matrix with nxn squares, n= number of nodes, but the matrix is symmetrical (if the connections are not directional), and on the diagonal is full of 0s, because there are no self connections.\n",
    "The matrix represents a link if theres a 1 in the posizion M\\[2\\]\\[3\\] so between nodes number 3 and 4 (python counts from 0)\n",
    "So we don't have n^2 information, just (n^2-n)/2, so n(n-1)/2, because it's symmetrical ( the fraction 2) and we have no information on the diagonal (the minus n).\n",
    "If we sum the elements in a column or row we find the degree of a node."
